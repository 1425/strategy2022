This is designed to make picks for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition

TODO:
-Switch to Ceres/cminwhatever for the least squares stuff.
-Improve the actual alliance evaluation
-Make it so that on the capabilities page, lists the data source

climb sets on an alliance:
	-would be interesting to know
	-would be interesting to know when those are because of penalty
	-can know if because of penalty when have zebra data that says they aren't close to where they'd need to be
	-can track when a robot is just dead if it isn't moving for a long time during the middle of the match
